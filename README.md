# emacs-config
This is the config I use for emacs, based off of [Derek Taylor's "Configuring Emacs"](https://gitlab.com/dwt1/configuring-emacs) Project. 

## Intended Configuration
This Config will primarily target my interests, though if you stumble upon this repo, and you want to contribute configurations for anything else, I'd be happy to integrate those ideas. 

### Targeted Languages
- **C++**
- **C**
- **Rust**
- **Go**
- Eventually **Ocaml**

## Usage
I personally prefer the usage of the **XDGConfig** location for setting up a
emacs config home, such as `~/.config/emacs/`. `~/.emacs.d` should also work.
